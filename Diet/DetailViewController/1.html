<br/>

<br/>
 1 cup blueberries or strawberries
<br/>
 1 cup orange juice with pulp
<br/>
<br/>

<b>Meal 4</b> 贸 Immediately post-workout
<br/>
<br/>
 1 scoop protein (or two scoops Grow!)
<br/>
 1 cup skim milk
<br/>
 15-18 ounces grape juice
<br/>
<br/>

<b>Meal 5</b> 贸 90 minutes post-workout
<br/>
<br/>
 1 scoop whey protein (or two scoops Grow!)
<br/>
 1 cup skim milk
<br/>
 15-18 ounces grape juice
<br/>
<br/>

<b>Meal 6</b>
<br/>
<br/>
 2 cups plain yogurt

On days that you don\'t work out, divide your daily numbers by six and try to take in the same amounts of protein, carbohydrates, and fat for each meal. So the 200-pound bodybuilder eating 3,840 calories (160 grams of protein, 107 grams of fat, and 560 grams of carbohydrates) each day would divide these numbers by six to yield 27 grams of protein, 18 grams of fat, and 93 grams of carbs for each meal.
